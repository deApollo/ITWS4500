I have created a dynamic weather display system using bootstrap, jquery,
forecast.io, and skycons by forecast.io.  

In general the system displays the current weather in the users location.  The
location is retrieved via the HTML5 geolocation api.  The weather information
is retrieved from forecast.io using their json api.  In addition to today's
weather information, the application also shows a scrolling list of the forecast
for the next week.  Upon reaching the end of the week, the display cycles back
to the first day in the forecast.

Skycons by forecast.io are used to make to application a little more lively.

Feel free to peruse the comments in the code for a more detailed look at how the
system functions internally.
